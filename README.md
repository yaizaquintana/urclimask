# Urban/Rural CLImate MASK definition (URCLIMASK)

This repository provides a set of tools developed within the framework of the **CORDEX Flagship Pilot Study (FPS) on URBan environments and Regional Climate Change (URB-RCC)** to identify **urban** and surrounding **rural** areas from **climate model** outputs, tailored to specific cities of interest. The code includes functionalities to assess **Urban Heat Island (UHI)** intensity, with configurable hyperparameters adaptable to different spatial resolutions and urban environments.

## Requirements

Scripts and (jupyter) notebooks are provided in [Python](https://www.python.org/) to ensure reproducibility and reusability of the results. The simplest way to match all these requirements is by using a dedicated [conda](https://docs.conda.io) environment, which can be easily installed by issuing:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:FPS-URB-RCC/urclimask.git
conda create -n urclimask
conda activate urclimask
cd urclimask
conda env update --file environment.yml --prune
pip install -e .
```

## Examples of use

Examples of use of the `urclimask` library are available in the form of [notebooks](https://github.com/FPS-URB-RCC/urclimask/tree/main/notebooks). To run the examples follow the following steps:

1. Download the folder [notebooks]() from the github repository, or navigate to the folder should you have cloned the repo.
2. Open jupyter notebook of Jupyter Lab (type `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`  in the terminal)
3. Open one of the tests available in the [notebooks]() folder with jupyter notebook  (e.g. [paris_across_CORDEX_resolutions.ipynb](https://github.com/FPS-URB-RCC/urclimask/blob/main/notebooks/paris_across_CORDEX_resolutions.ipynb))
